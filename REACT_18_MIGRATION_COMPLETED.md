# ✅ React 18 Migration Completed

## 🎯 Summary

Successfully modernized React Financial Charts monorepo to **React 18+ only**, dropping support for React 16 and 17. All packages now require React 18.0.0 or higher, with full React 19 compatibility.

## 📊 What Was Changed

### Dependencies Updated
- **Root package.json**: Added React 18.3.0 as explicit dependency
- **All 11 packages**: Updated peerDependencies from `^16.0.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0` to `^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`
- **Stories package**: Updated from React 18.2.0 to 18.3.0
- **Added overrides**: Ensure React 18.3+ across all transitive dependencies

### Packages Modified
1. `@react-financial-charts/annotations`
2. `@react-financial-charts/axes`
3. `@react-financial-charts/charts`
4. `@react-financial-charts/coordinates`
5. `@react-financial-charts/core`
6. `@react-financial-charts/indicators`
7. `@react-financial-charts/interactive`
8. `@react-financial-charts/scales`
9. `@react-financial-charts/series`
10. `@react-financial-charts/stories`
11. `@react-financial-charts/tooltip`

## 🔍 Before vs After

### Before
```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "react": "^16.0.0 || ^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0",

}
```
